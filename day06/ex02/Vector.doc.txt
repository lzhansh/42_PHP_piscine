<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles lines, directions and movements by 4 characteristics:
- X value
- Y value
- Z value
- w (homogeneous coordinate, arbitrary, default: 0.0)

For constructor, the following keys should be provided:
- dest: Destination vertex (mandatory)
- orig: Origin vertex (optional, def: 0,0,0)

The class provides the following methods :

Vertex doc();
Prints out this documentation file.

Each variable has get methods:
Vector getX();

Vector   magnitude();
Returns vector's length

Vector   normalize();
Returns new instance of Vector class normalized

Vector add( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the sum between current Vector and $rhs in new instance of
 Vector class

Vector sub( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the substract between current Vector and $rhs in new
instance of Vector class

Vector opposite()
Returns the opposite of the current Vector in new instance of Vector class

Vector scalarProduct( $k )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector and the scalar
$k in new instance of Vector class

Vector dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the scalar product between current Vector and the vector
$rhs in new instance of Vector class

Vector cos( Vector $rhs )
Returns vectors's cos

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs )
Returns the result of the cross product between current Vector and the vector
$rhs in new instance of Vector class
